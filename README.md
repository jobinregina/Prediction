# Prediction

Abalone are sea snails and in this project we are going to predict the age of abalone based on 8 pysiological characteristics. The age of abalone can be counted from the number of rings on it. So, we will be actually predicting the ring count and in turn geting the age. The data is collected from the UCI machine learning repository. The data set has 4177 samples and of the physiological charaacteristics most important is sex. We hardcoded the string male, female and young as 1, 2, 3. Other features we know includes Length,	Diameter,	Height,	Whole,	Shucked,	Viscera and	Shell. Keras + Scikit learn is the prediction library we are gonna use first in this study.
